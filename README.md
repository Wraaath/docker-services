# 🐳 Docker services
These are the services and applications running in my Homelab. \
This mf is very much a work in progress, so don't judge too hard.

## 💢 Why Docker?
Because I, contrary to popular belief, don't actually hate myself.

## 🚀 Deployment
1. Make sure you have Docker/docker-compose installed
Install with your Linux distro's package-manager or head over to [Dockers homepage](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) to install on Windows.

2. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wraaath-homelab/docker-services.git
```

3. Edit the `.env`-files accordingly. Do something like:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
```

4. Deploy the Docker-container from the compose file:
```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
